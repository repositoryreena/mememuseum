    <p>
      Hi! I spend way too much of my free time looking at memes on Pinterest—
      the niche ones, the vintage ones, the deeply cursed and oddly beautiful ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      I used to send memes individually to all my friends, but it got out of control.
      Like, who has the energy to forward 1,000 memes to 12 different people?
    </p>

    <p>
      So I decided to turn my studio apartment into a full-blown **meme museum**—with real prints
      on every wall—and this site is the digital version. A place where anyone can scroll through
      the chaos, the beauty, and the drama.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hope you enjoy. Send this to someone who deserves art today.
